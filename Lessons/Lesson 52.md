# 11/02/21: MP1 Search and Callbacks

## Phones and Apps
- The success or failure of a mobile (Apple iPhone vs Andriod phone) depends on the apps that are avaliable
- The way to increase apps for you device is the create a good expirience for app developers so they create apps for you phone
- Vice versa, it is in the app developers' best interest to make their application on both platforms so their app can be used by a variety of users
- Andriod invested in Andriod Studio to attract and make their developers happy

## Andriod Studio Terminology
- **Activity**: something that is displayed on screen
- **onCreate**: first method that is called when the app is launched
- **Event callbacks**: when the user interacts with a feature, this helps trigger the execution of the according action
- **Test Driven Development**: developing by zeroing in on one test, figuring out where it failed, and making changes accordingly Efficient and conventional way to develop!

## MP Notes
In our MP, **MainActivity** has 3 callback functions: in normal functions, methods are called. But for Andriod, when the user does something the callback function trigers the method (better efficiency)
- onQueryTextChange
- onClicked
- onQueryTextSubmit
