# 08/24/21: Variables and Types

- Java executed code line by line
- Type of variable must be included in variable declaration
- Type should not be included when changing value of already declared variable, since this indicated declaration
- The value of a variable is called a literal

``` java 
int n = 10;
n = 20;

int x; // Declare
x = 1; // Initialize
```

## 8 Primitive Types
- **Integer**: byte, short, int, long
  - The difference between these is that each stores a different range of values, i.e. long can store greater values than int
- **Floating point**: float, double
- **Boolean**: boolean
  - true/false 
- **Characters**: char
  - Enclosed by single quotes like so 'c'
