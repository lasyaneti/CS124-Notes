- Tips for organizing classes:
  - What does it store?
  - What does it do?
- The class name is important because it reflects what you are **modeling**
- Typically instance variables should always be marked private. You must judge whether you need getters and setters for each instance variable depending on the context of the variable. 
- For object class methods, list down the desired behavior and implement these.
